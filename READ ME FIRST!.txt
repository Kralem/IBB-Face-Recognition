To succesfully run my script you will need to:
-install the folowwing packages for python: 
	-Tensorflow + Keras (Keras comes with TF in pycharm, i don't know how this works in other environments)
	-numpy, scipy, matplotlib, os (i think this one is by default in python), OpenCV for python
- extract the zips (train, val, test) into a folder which you will name data
-you will need to have the data folder (with the val, train and test subfodlers) next to the ibb3.py script
-the ibb3.py script reads the images from the folders in data (example 'data/train/...')
-tensorflow and keras work best for python version 3.6-3.8, it did not work for me on 3.9 for some reason

Have fun with my script! :D
